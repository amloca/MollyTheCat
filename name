It was hard to come up with a good name for our cat. I wanted it to be unique but not difficult. My mom always thought that it pets names need end in an "e" sound. The original idea came from naming her after a country and the idea of Mali came to me. I liked it but we did stick with a more traditional spelling of Molly... mostly to simplify life.
